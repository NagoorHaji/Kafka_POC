Summarize
============
technically strong and has been able to perform consistently well in T&M project as a sole offshore resource. 
Being a strong Frontend  developer, He has also worked in Data Sync and SSIS Package requirements. Apart from project work, 
He has provided extended support in the development of prototypes for Proposals of Emerging portfolio.

Nagoor was an Onsite co-ordinator for GDVS Phase 3 delivery. He has worked in the planning and implementation of pre production activities,
deployment activities and warranty support including Defect fix, Code monitoring and Team coordination and contributed to seamless project delivery.
Nagoor got selected for T and M project in June and was able to prove his technical skills and stewardship in a short time. He has learnt 
.Net Core and handled challenging tasks like legacy code migration

Nagoor is a good individual contributor. He has taken ownership of few Modules like Genpo access, Bookings, 
Reports, etc. as part of Wave 1 and Wave 3. All of his modules were delivered as per the schedule. 
Since majority of modules he owned were medium complex, he was given additional responsibility of owning the Performance testing. 
The Performance testing sign-off got delayed due to delay in validating & fixing the observations, which could have been avoided. 
He is a very hard worker but need to improve his functional knowledge as well to justify his role at onsite

Though being new to project and role, he has done requirement and impact analysis within short duration. 
He has understood the requirements and prepared Technical Design documents which had very minimal review comments. 
He has delivered the modules to SIT as per the plan with minimal defects. Apart from development, 
he was Involved in project deployment activities and guided team on genpo access queries. 
Having proved his technical and leadership capability in delivery, 
he has to take up additional responsibilities like facing the audits, managing the SCM documents, etc.

Nagoor is good and technical standpoint. He is hardworking and committed. 
The quality of the deliverable are of high standards and have less defects. 
Would like him to lead a team and contribute to the solutioning aspects. Would also like him to learn new technologies.

Nagoor is a senior resource of the project and does justice to his role. In fact he picks up more responsibilities from assigning stories to the team, doing analysis on some new requirements for coming up with new stories etc.. He delivers all his assigned user stories on time and with quality. He is committed to the work and does deep analysis on any task assigned. He is very attentive during the calls and does not miss any points that are given. He provided support in Central time for a week when the application was released. He also provides weekend support for deployment activities. Being a senior member, he has to contribute to Recruitment drive whenever panels are required in his skillset He has to take learning sessions to new members in team and groom to next level.

Costcenter Hierarchy save issue.....
   User Story --- 2397  already requirement thier for Add/Edit mention...
   Missed developing based on UserStory by Arhan

Configuration Changes...(ShowAtPart... ShowAt)--- Machingng

Production Issue
================
Subline Save Issue....... (Confirm/Draft)  -- Not considered Subline..
   Save is not tested properly..

CSV Peff, Subline leve IsGlcPeff not considered but data entry working fine.  
   So he should be validated CSV peff with data entry screen

1. Performance Issue -- because of changes in Casecade  -- Issues
2. Date Issue -- Implementation of Momontum  -- Issues
3.  Worked on remvoing css(Improvement)
4.  WOrked on COmmon control implementation by getting minimal help from Senior resource
5. Code review.....
6. Testing he do very well..

Arpit
=====
Not coding consciesly.. 
Other person need to test if he coded.
API side Property mapping mistakes often doing... Exaple mapped ParId for Shift Id in   LineShift search fuctionalites
1. Show Active and Inactive items in dropdown, Left one problem.. (Because of without implementing)-- Not tested properly. 
Such that missed implementation for Line dropdown in Machine screen.
Some of the time they not going throught the assigned user story properly and miss some implementations.(For MaximoNumber to MaximoName field name and charlegth also needs be changed. But he considered changing field legnth only)

2. ShiftRotation Search(API implementation) -- Active status not changed in grid if that record status is updated in Edit screen.

Merge issue with Hot mix--- Did not understand the system...

Unnessary UI global property declaration doing.  So required keen code review before.(example just simple validation at save side he has declared many global variable in TS file that is not required)
If he Fixes somthing that opens other thing...  
And also he is not googling and finding solution for some cases he is depending on the our guide always.

====
1. Not capture all scenarios.....  Decimal should not be allowed for a text box even if user do copy past.... This scenario was missed.
2. He is not holding the list of issue that needs to be tested in QA if he aleady done in Dev(example Hot fix)
